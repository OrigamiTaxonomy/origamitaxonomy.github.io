    <p id="overview">This type of origami involves the joining of multiple units, usually by inserting flaps into pockets, to create a singular piece. While some people may not consider this “pure” origami, it gives the designer the power to create
      things that would not be possible from a single sheet, such as creating figures with “holes” like my Tennis Racket design below. While such designs are theoretically possible from a single sheet, the thickness of the paper would make folding
      far more difficult, sometimes physically impossible. Thus, I have no issue with modular designs myself.</p>
