    <p id="overview">Human figures are one of the toughest things to do well in origami. Getting the proportions right is one thing, but conveying emotion and form presents a far greater challenge, and one that I have only just begun to tackle. The late <a href="http://www.ericjoisel.fr/en/home/" target="_blank">Eric Joisel</a> was a master of human figures, taking an often-simple base and shaping it to the point where it looked like an elaborate sculpture. His work is full of life and creativity, reminding me in a world of computer-assisted design that the real challenge of origami is bringing it to life.</p>
