    <p id="overview">While plants are not usually the figure of choice for origami designs, I’ve always had a passion for growing them, especially if they produce fruit. Thus, it was only natural that I extend this passion to origami, especially my love of dragon
      fruits (see my <a href="https://dragonfruitobsession.github.io/" target="_blank">dragon fruit website</a>), which can probably be inferred from the models below. I also love designing things that to my knowledge have not really been explored in origami, which has led to some interesting designs, such as the
      Palora Dragon Fruit (without thorns) below. Maybe one day I’ll work up the courage to fold one with thorns.<br><br>*The observant reader will notice there is one more design than the number displayed. This is because one of the designs (*) incorporates a part of Robert Lang's cactus.</p>
