    <p id="overview">Making up the vast majority of all animal species, invertebrates are animals that don't have a vertebral column, also known as a spine or backbone. They are one of the most diverse groups of animals, ranging in size from microscopic insects to
      giant squids, with phyla such as arthropods, molluscs, annelids, echinoderms, flatworms, cnidarians, and sponges. One of the most difficult aspects in designing invertebrates is trying to replicate their often-numerous appendages. This calls
      for
      techniques such as box-pleating or circle-packing to create the base, and a large amount of shaping to thin the legs to a more realistic thickness, as in my ladybird design.</p>
